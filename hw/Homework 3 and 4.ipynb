    "In this exercise, you are requested to perform certain operations on images. The aim is to develop matrix manipulation skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a background information about how a grayscale image is represented on our computers. A grayscale image is basically a matrix where each matrix entry shows the intensity (brightness) level. In other words, when you take a picture with a digital camera, the image is represented by a numerical matrix where the matrix size is defined by the resolution setting of your camera. If your resolution setting is 1280x720, then your image is represented by 1280x720= 921600 pixel values (Actually that is why higher resolution provides better quality pictures). When you have a color image, the image stores the information of multiple channels depending on the image type. The most famous one is RGB type where R, G and B stand for “red”, “green” and “blue” respectively. Hence, you have a matrix as in greyscale images representing the intensity for each channel. Combining these matrices generates the color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the steps you need to follow for this task:\n",
    "- Take a picture of yours and save it as *.jpg or *.jpeg file.\n",
    "- Using an image editor (i.e. Paint in Windows), crop your head from the image and save it as separate image file (again *.jpg or *.jpeg). The resulting image is expected to be a square (i.e. has the same length and width), hence you should crop the image accordingly.\n",
    "- Resize the cropped image to size 512x512 px (pixel) using an image editor. This image is the one that you will use for this exercise."
